# Usage

1. Make a new telegram bot via @BotFather, get the token, send `/start` to your bot
2. Generate a misskey token
3. Download release, fill the `config.env`
4. Start it
5. Now you can send message to your telegram bot and it will forward to misskey

**Note**: program will read from environment variables directly if you don't have a `config.env` file, set necessary environment variables manually if you want to use this way.
